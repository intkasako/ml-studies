# Logistic Regression — Loan Approval Classification

Implementation of logistic regression with gradient descent from scratch using NumPy, applied to a binary loan approval classification problem.

## What it does
- Predicts whether a client will pay back a loan (1) or default (0)
- Uses 3 features: monthly income, current debt, and credit score
- Applies Z-score feature scaling before training
- Runs gradient descent for 1000 iterations
- Predicts probability for a new client

## Concepts covered
- Feature scaling (Z-score standardization) with multiple features
- Sigmoid activation function
- Log loss (binary cross-entropy) cost function
- Gradient descent for classification
- Binary decision boundary (threshold = 0.5)

## Key insight
Debt was the strongest predictor — its weight is negative, reflecting that higher debt reduces the probability of repayment. Feature scaling was essential due to large differences in scale between features (income in thousands vs score out of 100).

## Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
```bash
python logistic_regression_loan.py
```
